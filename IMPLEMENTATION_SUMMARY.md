# Implementation Summary: HA Data Access for MCP Server

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive Home Assistant data access capabilities to the MCP Server integration, allowing full visibility and control of users, integrations, devices, and entities through standardized services.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. User Management Services
- **list_users**: Lists all Home Assistant users with their metadata
  - Returns: user IDs, names, owner status, active status, system generated flag
- **get_user**: Retrieves detailed information about a specific user
  - Returns: Full user profile including groups and permissions

### 2. Integration Management Services
- **list_integrations**: Lists all configured integration entries
  - Returns: Entry IDs, domains, titles, states, sources
- **get_integration**: Retrieves detailed configuration for a specific integration
  - Returns: Full config entry including data and options

### 3. Device Management Services
- **list_devices**: Lists all devices with optional domain filtering
  - Supports filtering by domain (e.g., only 'light' devices)
  - Returns: Device IDs, names, manufacturers, models, versions, identifiers
- **get_device**: Retrieves detailed information about a specific device
  - Returns: Complete device metadata including area assignments and configuration entries

### 4. Entity Management Services
- **list_entities**: Lists all entities with optional domain filtering
  - Supports filtering by domain (e.g., only 'sensor' entities)
  - Returns: Entity IDs, names, platforms, current states
- **get_entity**: Retrieves detailed information and current state of an entity
  - Returns: Full entity metadata, state, attributes, timestamps, capabilities
- **update_entity_state**: Updates the state and attributes of an entity
  - Useful for virtual entities and testing scenarios
- **get_entity_history**: Retrieves historical state data for an entity
  - Supports custom time ranges
  - Returns: Historical states with attributes and timestamps
  - Defaults to last 24 hours

## Technical Details

### Service Schemas
All services use voluptuous schemas for input validation:
- String fields for IDs and entity IDs
- Optional fields for filtering (domain, time ranges)
- Proper validation using Home Assistant's cv module

### Home Assistant API Integration
The implementation leverages official Home Assistant APIs:
- `hass.auth` for user management
- `hass.config_entries` for integration management
- Device Registry (`homeassistant.helpers.device_registry`)
- Entity Registry (`homeassistant.helpers.entity_registry`)
- State machine (`hass.states`)
- History component (`homeassistant.components.history`)

### Error Handling
- Proper error messages for missing resources
- Value errors for invalid IDs
- File not found errors for non-existent entities

### Security Considerations
- All services run with the same permissions as Home Assistant
- No additional privilege escalation
- Follows HA's existing security model
- User authentication handled by HA

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- 15 total tests (all passing)
- 7 new tests for HA data access services
- 8 existing tests for configuration file management
- Mock-based testing using unittest.mock
- Async test support with pytest-asyncio

### Test Files
- `tests/test_ha_services.py`: New HA data access service tests
- `tests/test_mcp_server.py`: Existing config file management tests

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Added new feature descriptions
- Documented all new services with YAML examples
- Updated API reference section

### info.md
- Updated feature list to include new capabilities

### QUICKSTART.md
- Added new service examples
- Added common use cases for new features

### CHANGELOG.md
- Documented all new features in [Unreleased] section

### Example Scripts
- `example_ha_usage.py`: Comprehensive examples of all new services

## Code Quality

### Formatting
- All Python code formatted with Black
- Consistent style throughout

### File Organization
- Services defined in `__init__.py`
- Service schemas documented in `services.yaml`
- Clear separation of concerns

### Line Count
- `__init__.py`: 456 lines (from ~140 lines)
- Added ~300 lines of new functionality
- Minimal changes to existing code

## Use Cases

### System Monitoring
- List all entities to check system health
- Get entity history to analyze trends
- Monitor integration status

### Device Management
- Discover all devices in the system
- Find devices by manufacturer or model
- Check device firmware versions

### Automation Development
- List available entities for automation triggers
- Test entity state changes
- Validate automation configurations

### Data Analysis
- Export entity history for analysis
- Track user activity
- Monitor integration performance

### System Administration
- Audit user accounts
- Review integration configurations
- Manage entity states

## Compatibility

### Home Assistant Versions
- Designed to work with current HA API patterns
- Uses standard HA helper modules
- Follows HA best practices

### Dependencies
No new dependencies added:
- Uses existing HA modules
- Leverages built-in registries
- No additional Python packages required

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
1. Area management services (list/get areas)
2. Automation management (beyond config files)
3. Scene and script management
4. Zone management
5. Notification services
6. Event history access
7. Logbook access
8. Statistics and recorder data

## Summary

This implementation successfully adds comprehensive Home Assistant data access to the MCP Server integration, providing:
- ✅ Full visibility into users, integrations, devices, and entities
- ✅ Ability to query historical data
- ✅ Ability to update entity states
- ✅ Domain-based filtering for devices and entities
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Complete documentation and examples
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Follows HA best practices and conventions

The integration now provides a complete view of the Home Assistant system through standardized MCP services, enabling advanced automation, monitoring, and management capabilities.
